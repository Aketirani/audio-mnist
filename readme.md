### Dataset
This project utilizes a comprehensive [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/primaryobjects/voicegender) with 30,000 spoken digits (0-9) audio samples from 60 distinct speakers. Each speaker's directory contains their audio recordings and a meta-information file.

### Data Summary
Explore a detailed data profiling report by opening the `html/profiling_report.html` file in your web browser. This report offers statistical insights, distribution plots, and a comprehensive overview of the dataset's characteristics.

### Model Selection
The choice of [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is based on its efficiency and scalability, especially for large datasets and complex models. It effectively handles missing values, categorical variables, and high-dimensional data, making it well-suited for this project. XGBoost's regularization techniques help prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.

### Model Architecture
A gradient boosting tree ensemble model within the XGBoost framework is employed. This model synergizes predictions from multiple decision trees to determine the speaker's gender. Fine-tuning is achieved through key parameters, allowing for optimal performance.

The model uses the following key parameters:
| Parameter       | Description          |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `learning_rate` | Learning Rate        |
| `max_depth`     | Max Depth Of Tree    |
| `n_estimators`  | Number Of Estimators |
| `objective`     | Objective Function   |
| `tree_method`   | Tree Method          |

### Model Features
The model uses various statistical features from both time-domain and frequency-domain data of the audio samples. These features are crucial for training the model to recognize gender-specific patterns.

These features include:
| Feature     | Description        |
|-------------|--------------------|
| `mean`      | Mean               |
| `std`       | Standard Deviation |
| `med`       | Median             |
| `min`       | Minimum            |
| `q25`       | 25th Percentiles   |
| `q75`       | 75th Percentiles   |
| `max`       | Maximum            |
| `skew`      | Skewness           |
| `kurt`      | Kurtosis           |
| `zeroxrate` | Zero Crossing Rate |
| `entropy`   | Entropy            |
| `sfm`       | Spectral Flatness  |
| `cent`      | Frequency Centroid |

### Model Performance
The model has achieved a promising accuracy rate of `96.70%` on the test dataset, showcasing its potential in gender recognition through voice analysis.

### PostgreSQL Integration
PostgreSQL integration enhances data management capabilities. By utilizing [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), an open-source object-relational database system, we ensure scalability, robustness, and efficient data storage and retrieval. Store connection details in the `config/postgres.yaml` file and perform database operations using SQL queries.

### Conclusion
This project exemplifies the application of machine learning in voice and speech analysis, showcasing the potential to discern gender through acoustic features.
